# Write a playbook ~/playbooks/logrotate.yml to configure log-rotation on
# remote hosts.

# Complete the following tasks:

# Grab the module from GitHub: https://github.com/arillso/ansible.logrotate
# Use ansible-galaxy install command to install inside the /home/thor/playbooks/roles
# If you stumbled upon the issue, could not find/use git,
# install git in the ansible-runner first and install the role.

# Configure your log rotation rules as:

# daily
# rotate 3
# compress
# â€¦to rotate a log file that would present on location /var/log/myapp.log

# That means rotate daily, compress the log file and keep the last three rotations.
# Check on the options section that the role provides.
# Since this role depends on facts on remote hosts, make sure to gather
# facts is not false.

ansible-galaxy install git+https://github.com/arillso/ansible.logrotate --roles-path ~/playbooks/roles
