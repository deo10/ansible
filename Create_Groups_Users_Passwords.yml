#There is already an inventory file ~/playbooks/inventory on jump host.
#a. Add all users given in the users.yml file on app server 3.
#b. Also add developers and admins groups on the same server.
#c. As per the list given in the users.yml file, make each user member of the respective group they are listed under.
#d. Make sure home directory for all of the users under developers group is /var/www (not the default i.e /var/www/{USER}). Users under admins group should use the default home directory (i.e /home/devid for user devid).
#e. Set password GyQkFRVNr3 for all of the users under developers group and TmPcZjtRQx for of the users under admins group. Make sure to use the password given in the ~/playbooks/secrets/vault.txt file as Ansible vault password to encrypt the original password strings. You can use ~/playbooks/secrets/vault.txt file as a vault secret file while running the playbook (make necessary changes in ~/playbooks/ansible.cfg file).
#f. All users under admins group must be added as sudo users. To do so, simply make them member of the wheel group as well.
