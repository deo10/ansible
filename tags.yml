# There are several reasons why you might use tags in Ansible:
# Selective Execution:
# Tags allow you to execute only specific tasks within a playbook instead of running the entire playbook.
# This can be useful when you want to perform targeted actions, such as configuring specific services or components, without affecting others.
# Efficient Debugging:
# Tags can help in debugging by allowing you to isolate and focus on specific tasks during troubleshooting.
# Instead of running the entire playbook, you can run only the tasks related to the specific tag, which can save time and resources.
# Modularization:
# Tags facilitate the modularization of playbooks by grouping related tasks together under specific tags.
# This improves readability and maintainability, as it makes it easier to understand the purpose and function of each task within the playbook.
# Customization and Flexibility:
# Tags provide flexibility in playbook execution by allowing you to define custom tags for tasks based on your requirements.
# This enables you to customize playbook runs according to different scenarios or environments.

- name: Start the ntp service
  service:
    name: ntpd
    state: started
    enabled: yes
  tags: ntp # line indicates that this particular task is tagged with "ntp". This means you can execute only tasks tagged with "ntp" by using the --tags option when running the playbook. For example:

---
#command:
ansible-playbook playbook.yml --tags ntp

#This command would execute only tasks tagged with "ntp" in the playbook, skipping any other tasks that are not tagged with "ntp".
